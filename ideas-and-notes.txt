Chrome extension getting started (https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/):

- Extensions are made of different, but cohesive, components. Components can include BACKGROUND SCRIPTS, 
  CONTENT SCRIPTS, an OPTIONS PAGE, UI ELEMENTS and various logic files


BACKGROUND SCRIPTS (https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/service_workers/):

- Previously we could run background scripts on background-pages (THIS IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED)
- We now run them with service_workers
